*TASK:TASK-2 (LEVEL-1)

##*PROJECT OVERVIEW

The *Number Guessing Game* is a simple, fun, and engaging console-based application built using Java. The core idea of this project is to create an interactive experience where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. This game demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input handling, and random number generation 

This project is ideal for beginners who are just stepping into Java programming and want to get hands-on experience with basic coding principles in a practical way

## Features

- *Random Number Generation*: The program generates a random integer between 1 and 100 each time the game starts.
- *User Interaction*: The user is prompted to guess the number, and the program responds with hints — whether the guess is too high or too low.
- *Attempt Count*: The number of attempts taken by the user to guess the correct number is displayed at the end.
- *Replayability*: Each run of the program is different as the target number is generated randomly

## Tools and Technologies Used

- *Java Programming Language*: The core logic and structure of the application are written in Java.
- *Scanner Class*: Used to read the user’s input from the console.
- *Random Class*: Utilized for generating the number that the user will attempt to guess.
- *Java Development Kit (JDK)*: Required to compile and run the Java application.
- *Text Editor or IDE*: The project was created using an environment like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA with Java extensions enabled.
- *Git & GitHub*: Used for version control and to host the source code in a public repository for others to view or collaborate

## How It Works

1. When the program starts, it initializes a random number between 1 and 100 using Java’s Random class.
2. The user is welcomed and asked to guess the number.
3. After each guess:
   - If the guessed number is too low, the user is told to guess higher.
   - If the guessed number is too high, the user is told to guess lower.
   - If the guessed number matches the generated number, the game congratulates the user and shows the number of attempts taken
4. The game ends once the correct number is guessed

## Applicability

Although simple, this number guessing game models real-world interaction and can be used as a foundational base for:
- *Basic Game Development*: Serves as an introduction to game logic and control flow.
- *Java Learning Projects*: A great beginner project to apply basic concepts in a fun and interactive manner.
- *Coding Challenges and Interviews*: Frequently used as a warm-up or screening question to assess a candidate’s understanding of control structures and logic building.
- *Logical Thinking Enhancement*: Encourages thinking in terms of range narrowing, which is fundamental in binary search and other algorithms

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this project allowed me to:
- Understand and implement Java’s built-in classes such as Scanner and Random.
- Practice using loops (while), conditionals (if-else), and variable tracking (attempts).
- Develop a user-interactive application that responds dynamically based on input.
- Strengthen problem-solving and debugging skills.
- Gain familiarity with compiling and running Java programs from the terminal or an IDE.
- Learn to document and share code using GitHub for portfolio building

## Conclusion

The *Number Guessing Game* is a perfect beginner-level project that introduces the essential building blocks of Java programming in a fun and interactive way. It teaches not just how to write code, but also how to think logically and design user-friendly programs. This project is a testament to how small ideas can be powerful tools for learning, and I look forward to building on this foundation with more advanced projects in the future
